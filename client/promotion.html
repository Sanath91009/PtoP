    Sanath_kumar gave a contest in codeforces and now he wants to discuss with
    other participants but he could not able to do that as he don't have any
    friends group who are interested in competitive programming. So he gave up
    on his desire and continued to participate in contests for quite a good
    amount of time with having a small amount of peer discussion.
</p>
<p>
    Now he feels that peer discussion is THE most important thing that one
    should do after participitating in a contest. So Sanath_kumar with the help
    of shadar && 7vivann designed a platform where competitive programmers can
    go and requets other to join a room or can accept requests or can randomly
    pair with other participants by server.
